_This is my latest attempt at mastering the art of "Doing it Wrong"_

### [Use it](https://pure.xorcery.co/)

I present to you a decentralized ultra-portable Markdown editor it's entire code base occupying a single file less than 256kB.

You can just right click + save the webpage
and the app will continue to work when opened from `file:`-system
and of course without any requirements for an internet connection.

To make things a bit more interesting, the markdown documents you produce
are _fictionally_ limited to 1kB, and live
inside one of the most portable data structures available the `URL`.

**``- It's the digital equivalent of a Postcard´´**

### Release 2.x

Rewrote entire codebase to use [picostack](https://github.com/telamon/picostack) in blockend and vanillaJS nuro/tonic in frontend.

Also It grew to ~500KB due to piconet/swarm stuff.

If you're reading this it means that the docs are missing or in a bad state.

Writing and maintaining friendly and useful documentation takes
effort and time.
