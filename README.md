# 1k.rant

> [Smallest markdown editor in the world](https://telamon.github.io/rant/)

_This is my latest attempt at mastering the art of "Doing it Wrong"_

I present to you a decentralized ultra-portable Markdown editor it's entire code base occupying a single file less than 256kB.

You can just right click + save the webpage
and the app will continue to work when opened from `file:`-system
and of course without any requirements for an internet connection.

To make things a bit more interesting, the markdown documents you produce
are _fictionally_ limited to 1kB, and stored in the [worlds smallest blockchain](https://github.com/telamohn/picofeed) that it self lives
inside one of the most portable data structure available, the `URL`.


!ðŸ’Œ!

**``- It's the digital equivalent of a PostcardÂ´Â´**


(or an essential tool for people who love to rant but
have issues sticking to a chosen topic.)

If you're reading this it means that the docs are missing or in a bad state.

Writing and maintaining friendly and useful documentation takes
effort and time. In order to avoid wasting precious resources
I will from now on provide documentation relational to project activity.

- no remote APIs
- single static file
- minimal-size

Use [picofeed](https://github.com/telamon/picofeed) as database & transport.

This is a project template for generating microscopic viral applications using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev).

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npx degit telamon/cybermite-template my-app
cd my-app
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*


## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd my-app
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.


## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies` so that the app will work when you deploy to platforms like [Heroku](https://heroku.com).


## Single-page app mode

By default, sirv will only respond to requests that match files in `public`. This is to maximise compatibility with static fileservers, allowing you to deploy your app anywhere.

If you're building a single-page app (SPA) with multiple routes, sirv needs to be able to respond to requests for *any* path. You can make it so by editing the `"start"` command in package.json:

```js
"start": "sirv public --single"
```


## Deploying to the web

### With [now](https://zeit.co/now)

Install `now` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g now
```

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash
cd public
now deploy --name my-project
```

As an alternative, use the [Now desktop client](https://zeit.co/download) and simply drag the unzipped project folder to the taskbar icon.

### With [surge](https://surge.sh/)

Install `surge` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g surge
```

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash
npm run build
surge public my-project.surge.sh
```
