## üéâ Welcome!
This App is the equivalent of a digital Postcard.

## üíæ 1 Kilo Byte
Just like a real postcard, there's a limit to how much information it can fit.
This postcard is limited to \`1 kilo byte\` of text, how much is that?

You see, this message lives entierly inside the URL - no database needed!

If we further imbue this card with the magical powers of Cryptography.
Then we get a tool that can be used for:

- It can fit a secret love letter.
- You can flip someone off.
- Start a revolution.
- Decide where to eat next.

## Plain text
Just because we're writing in plain text mean that it has to look boring!
We have full markdown support.
Using the theme-selector above you can choose the color of your postcard.

Ok we have about 300 bytes remaining.
